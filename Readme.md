# DevEvolution-2023to2025 ðŸš€

This repository is a **time capsule** of my earliest web development projects from **June 2023**â€”a reminder of where I started and how far I've come.

## ðŸ“– The Backstory
In **June 2023**, I built this simple portfolio using **HTML & CSS** to showcase two beginner projects:
- **Movie Ranking Project** ðŸŽ¬ - A static webpage listing my favorite movies.
- **Birthday Invite Project** ðŸŽ‰ - A basic invitation page.

Back then, I was just getting started with **HTML, structuring pages, and linking files**. Fast forward to **2025**, and now I work with:  
âœ… **React** (Dynamic frontends)  
âœ… **Flask** (Backend development)  
âœ… **Tailwind CSS** (Modern styling)  
âœ… **JavaScript & SQL** (Full-stack capabilities)  
âœ… **3D Animations** (Advanced UI/UX)

This project is a **testament to my evolution**, from basic static pages to building complex full-stack applications.

**This project represents my starting point in web developmentâ€”just simple HTML pages back then. From here, I moved on to CSS, JavaScript, Flask, full-stack applications, and beyond. Looking back at this reminds me of how far I've come and how much more there is to learn.** ðŸš€
